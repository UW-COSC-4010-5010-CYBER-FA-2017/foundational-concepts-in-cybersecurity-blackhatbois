In LeastPriviledgeNonExample.cpp, it shows how one entity has the priviledge to enter and change the names of the users of the application. Doing this would allow a one stop shop for someone to steal information, or alter the records.

In LeastPriviledge.cpp, the processes have been split up so not just one entity can have complete control of the situation. The job must be split up to ensure some semblance of security. 

makefile for good example: Princ4ExMake.mk
for bad example: Princ4NEMake.mk
